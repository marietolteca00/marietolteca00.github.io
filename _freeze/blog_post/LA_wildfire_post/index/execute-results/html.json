NPR. Satellite image ©2025 Maxar Technologies (January 9, 2025)](satellite_image.jpeg)\n\n### Background\nThe Eaton and Palisades fires were two recent major wildfires that started from strong Santa Ana winds, dry vegetation from previous wet winters, and potential issues with electrical transmission lines. Both wildfires started simultaneously in Los Angeles County on January 07, 2025. These wildfires burned around 60 square miles and destroying thousands of structures and vegetation[(Fritz and Park)](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/14/climate/los-angeles-fires-worse-global-warming/index.html). A total of 37,000 acres burned across the Eaton and Palisades wildfires [(Hoffman, et. al.,2025)](https://abcnews.go.com/US/la-wildfires-aftermath-insurance-housing-rebuild-update/story?id=119209482).\n\n### Purpose\nA NetCDF (.nc) file containing Landsat raster data for Los Angeles County will be used, covering the areas affected by two wildfires in 2025. The file includes a simplified collection of bands: red, green, blue, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared, from Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data, obtained by the Landsat 8 satellite. The Eaton and Palisades fire perimeter shapefiles will be projected onto the Landsat imagery, which will be visualized using false-color composites to highlight burned and vegetated areas. Additionally, potential social factors influencing wildfire impacts are investigated using the California Environmental Justice Index (EJI) dataset.\n\n# About Data\nMicrosoft Planetary Computer, https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/landsat-c2-l2, is used in this notebook that outlines the fire perimeters for the Palisades and Eaton Fire. This was our data landsat data for the fire perimeters. `landsat8-2025-02-23-palisades-eaton.nc`\n\nFrom the County of Los Angeles GIS, was retrieved for both fire perimeters of `Palisades` and `Eaton` fire as a shapefile (shp) each were added to a folder. \n\n- `eji`: Is a geodatabase folder, that has rankings of geographic levels that represent comparison to all other census tracts.\n- `eaton_boundary`:` Layer contains a dissolved fire perimeter for the eaton fire. (01/21/2025)\n- `palisades_boundary`: Layer contains a dissolved fire perimeter for the palisades fire. (01/21/2025)\n- `landsat`: This `nc` file contains a collection of bands (red, blue, green, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmosperically adjusted surface reflectance data, obtained by the Landsat 8 satellite. This data has been clipped to an area of Los Angeles County to include both fire perimeters.\n\nThis repository contains code and materials for analyzing Landsat imagery and mapping wildfire perimeters in Los Angeles County. It demonstrates how to:\n- Work with NetCDF (.nc) Landsat data\n- Create true-color (RGB) and false-color composites\n- Overlay geospatial data to visualize fire boundaries\n- Develop clear and reproducible geospatial workflows\n- Identify a social dimension using EJI to explore potential vulnerability patterns within fire perimeters\n\nThe focus is on the Eaton and Palisades Fires, combining satellite imagery with official fire perimeter shapefiles to explore fire-affected areas.\n\n### Highlights:\n- Data Wrangling\n- Restoring geospatial information\n- False color imagery\n- EJI Social Variable\n\n\n### Data Access\n- The Landsat .nc file can be downloaded from a shared Google Drive folder provided by the instructor for the course EDS 220 – Working with Environmental Datasets: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1USqhiMLyN8GE05B8WJmHabviJGnmAsLP\n- Fire perimeter shapefiles for the Palisades and Eaton fires were obtained from the County of Los Angeles GIS:\nCounty. https://egis-lacounty.hub.arcgis.com/maps/ad51845ea5fb4eb483bc2a7c38b2370c/about\n- Each shapefile contains a dissolved fire perimeter for its respective fire and has been added to the data folder in this repository.\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry.

The code then checks whether the datasets share the same Coordinate Reference System (CRS) and transforms the EJI layer to match the CRS of the fire perimeter datasets. After aligning the CRS, spatial joins are performed between EJI and each fire perimeter to identify overlapping features.

Before processing, any missing values (NaN) in the Landsat bands will be filled to prevent errors, RGB and false-color composites will be created for visualization, and the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeter shapefiles will be reprojected to match the Landsat CRS.

The code transforms both fire perimeter layers to the Landsat CRS and then prints their CRS values to verify that the transformation was successful.\n\n### False-Color Landsat Imagery\n#### Eaton and Palisades Fire Perimeters\nFalse-color imagery assigns non-visible wavelengths (like infrared) to the red, green, and blue color channels to reveal features not apparent in natural color images. This analysis uses a SWIR, NIR, and Red composite where short-wave infrared (SWIR), near-infrared (NIR), and red bands are displayed, making it particularly effective for assessing wildfire damage. In the false-color imagery composite, healthy vegetation appears bright green due to high near-infrared reflectance, while burned areas show as dark brown. The following visualization overlays the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeters on this false-color composite to assess fire extent and severity.\n\n::: {#4d1c4e33 .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Set up fig, ax\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,10))\n\n# Plot false-color background first\nfalse_color.plot.imshow(robust=True)\n\n# Overlay fire perimeters\neaton.boundary.plot(ax=ax, color=\"hotpink\", linewidth=2, label=\"Eaton Fire\", facecolor = \"lightpink\", alpha = 0.6)\npalisades.boundary.plot(ax=ax, color=\"red\", linewidth=2, label=\"Palisades Fire\", facecolor = \"indianred\", alpha = 0.6)\n\n# Legend Patches\npal_legend = mpatches.Patch(facecolor=\"indianred\", edgecolor=\"red\", alpha=0.6, label=\"Palisades Fire\")\neaton_legend = mpatches.Patch(facecolor=\"lightpink\", edgecolor=\"hotpink\", alpha=0.6, label=\"Eaton Fire\")\n\n# Zoom to fire extents - This is for the bound limits\nxmin = min(eaton.total_bounds[0], palisades.total_bounds[0]) - 500\nxmax = max(eaton.total_bounds[2], palisades.total_bounds[2]) + 500\nymin = min(eaton.total_bounds[1], palisades.total_bounds[1]) - 500\nymax = max(eaton.total_bounds[3], palisades.total_bounds[3]) + 500\n\n# Set limits\nax.set_xlim(xmin, xmax)\nax.set_ylim(ymin, ymax) \n\n# Title\nax.set_title(\"SWIR-NIR-Red False Color Composite with Fire Perimeters\")\n\n# Legend\nax.legend(handles=[eaton_legend, pal_legend], \n          loc=\"upper left\",\n          title=\"Fire Perimeters\",\n          # Background of legend\n          frameon=True)\nax.set_axis_off()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-9-output-1.png){width=763 height=316}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Interpretation\nThe false-color composite effectively reveals the wildfire impact across Los Angeles County. Bright green areas indicate healthy vegetation with high near-infrared reflectance, while dark brown areas within the fire perimeters show where vegetation has been destroyed. The Palisades Fire (red boundary) and Eaton Fire (pink boundary) extents are clearly visible, with burned areas appearing as distinctly darker patches compared to surrounding unburned landscape.\n\n\n# Eaton and Palisades Fire Perimeters (Basemap)\nTo better understand the spatial extent and location of the Eaton and Palisades fires relative to surrounding communities and infrastructure, we will use `OpenStreeMap` basemap. With the OpenStreetMap, it will overlay the fire perimeters, which provides roads, highways, and city boundaries for geographic context. The Eaton and Palisades clipped version will be used here.\n\n::: {#6a9299f0 .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(14, 12))\n\n# Fire Perimeter- Eaton\neaton_clip.plot(ax=ax, color='orange', alpha=0.3)  # Inside\neaton_clip.plot(ax=ax, color='none', edgecolor='red', linewidth=1.5)  # Border\n\n# Fire Perimeter- Palisades\npalisades_clip.plot(ax=ax, color='blue', alpha=0.3)  # Inside\npalisades_clip.plot(ax=ax, color='none', edgecolor='darkblue', linewidth=1.5)  # Border\n\n# Legend Patches\npal_legend = mpatches.Patch(facecolor=\"blue\", edgecolor=\"darkblue\", alpha=0.3, label=\"Palisades Fire\")\neaton_legend = mpatches.Patch(facecolor=\"orange\", edgecolor=\"red\", alpha=0.3, label=\"Eaton Fire\")\n\n# Legend\nax.legend(handles=[eaton_legend, pal_legend], \n          loc=\"upper left\",\n          title=\"Fire Perimeters\",\n          # Background of legend\n          frameon=True)\n\n# Title\nax.set_title(\"2025 Eaton and Palisades Fire\")\n\n# Axes off\nax.axis('off')\n\n# Basemap\nctx.add_basemap(ax, source=ctx.providers.OpenStreetMap.Mapnik)\n\nplt.show()\n\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-10-output-1.png){width=1061 height=428}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Interpretation\nThis map shows the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeters overlaid on an OpenStreetMap basemap, providing crucial geographic context. Compared to the earlier Landsat false-color imagery, this visualization makes it much easier to identify which specific communities, roads, and infrastructure were affected by each fire. The basemap reveals that both fires occurred in densely populated areas of Los Angeles County, with major highways and residential neighborhoods clearly visible within and adjacent to the fire boundaries. The semi-transparent fire perimeters allow viewers to see underlying street networks and topography, helping to understand how terrain and urban development may have influenced fire spread patterns. \n\n# EJI Spatial Join and Clip\n### EJI U.S. Census Tracts with Eaton and Palisades Fire Perimeters\nBefore performing any spatial analysis, the EJI census tract dataset was reprojected to match the CRS of the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeter datasets to ensure consistent spatial alignment across all layers. Although spatial joins and clipping were performed earlier, reprojection had not been performed, making this step necessary to enable valid spatial overlay operations.\nIn this section, spatial joins are used to identify U.S. census tracts that intersect with the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeters, helping determine which communities were impacted by each fire. The EJI census tract data are then clipped to the fire perimeter boundaries to extract only the portions of tracts located within the burned areas.\n\n### Reprojection\nReproject EJI to match Palisades and Eaton CRS, before spatial join. These steps are repeated from data wrangling section since now reprojection was made in order to clip the EJI census tracts.\n\n::: {#c5859b01 .cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Reproject EJI to match Palisades CRS\nif eji.crs != palisades.crs:\n  # Transform if CRS are different\n    eji = eji.to_crs(palisades.crs)\n\nif eji.crs != eaton.crs:\n    # Transform if CRS are different\n    eji = eji.to_crs(eaton.crs)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Spatial Join\nIn this section, the information in EJI will be joined with the fire perimeter of Eaton and Palisades, using intersects.\nA spatial join identifies ALL census tracts that have ANY overlap with the fire perimeters, even if only partially affected. This allows to view a complete list of potentially impacted communities. A visual plot will be shown to visually see the spatial joins.\n\n::: {#de66f93a .cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Spatially join EJI and Palisades\neji_palisades = gpd.sjoin(eji,palisades,predicate=\"intersects\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#e4f71adc .cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Spatially join EJI and Eaton\neji_eaton = gpd.sjoin(eji,eaton,predicate=\"intersects\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Visualize Eaton and Palisades (Joined EJI)\n\n::: {#77542a84 .cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Define figure and axis dimensions\nfig, ax= plt.subplots(figsize = (10,10))\n\n# Joined with EJI\neji_palisades.plot(ax=ax, edgecolor= \"black\", facecolor= \"grey\", linewidth = 3)\n\n# Palisades Reprojected\npalisades.plot(ax=ax, edgecolor= \"hotpink\", color= \"none\", linewidth = 3)\n\n# Set title\nax.set_title(\"U.S Census Tracts Affected by Palisades Wildfire\")\n\n# Turn off axis ticks\nax.set_axis_off()\n\n\n# Show plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-14-output-1.png){width=763 height=559}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#6c8eda32 .cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Define figure and axis dimensions\nfig, ax= plt.subplots(figsize = (10,10))\n\n# Joined with EJI\neji_eaton.plot(ax=ax, edgecolor= \"black\", facecolor= \"grey\", linewidth = 3)\n\n# Eaton Reprojected\neaton.plot(ax=ax, edgecolor= \"hotpink\", color= \"none\", linewidth = 3)\n\n# Set title\nax.set_title(\"U.S Census Tracts Affected by Eaton Wildfire\")\n\n# Turn off axis ticks\nax.set_axis_off()\n\n\n# Show plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-15-output-1.png){width=763 height=345}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe spatial join identified all census tracts that intersect the fires, but included areas outside the fire boundaries.\n\n### Clip EJI with Fire Perimeters\nAs shown in the spatial join visualizations above, the census tracts extend beyond the fire perimeters, meaning we're including areas that were not actually burned.

In the Palisades area it is more common for more homeowners to own homes and rent them out since it is near a beach and often added to vacation rentals. The Eaton area is located in the foothills and canyons of the San Gabriel Mountains, near the cities of Altadena and Pasadena mountain ranges. \n\n::: {#c217e966 .cell execution_count=19}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 10))\n\n# Add EJI Variable - Using Metadata\neji_variable = 'E_RENTER'\n\n# Find common min/max for legend range\nvmin = min(eji_palisades_clip[eji_variable].min(), eji_palisades_clip[eji_variable].min())\nvmax = max(eji_eaton_clip[eji_variable].max(), eji_eaton_clip[eji_variable].max())\n\n# Plot census tracts within Palisades perimeter\neji_palisades_clip.plot(\ncolumn= eji_variable,\nvmin=vmin, vmax=vmax,\nlegend=False,\nax=ax1,\ncmap='viridis',\nedgecolor=\"grey\")\n\nax1.set_title('Palisades Fire')\nax1.axis('off')\n\n# Plot census tracts within Eaton perimeter\neji_eaton_clip.plot(\ncolumn=eji_variable,\nvmin=vmin, vmax=vmax,\nlegend=False,\nax=ax2,\ncmap='viridis',\nedgecolor=\"grey\")\n\nax2.set_title('Eaton Fire')\nax2.axis('off')\n\n# Add overall title\nfig.suptitle('Renter-Occupied Housing\\nPercentile within Fire Perimeters',weight='bold')\n\n\n# Add shared colorbar at the bottom\nsm = plt.cm.ScalarMappable(norm=plt.Normalize(vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax), cmap = 'viridis')\ncbar_ax = fig.add_axes([0.25, 0.08, 0.5, 0.02]) # [left, bottom, width, height]\ncbar = fig.colorbar(sm, cax=cbar_ax, orientation='horizontal')\ncbar.set_label('Percentile of Housing Units, Occupied by Renter')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-20-output-1.png){width=763 height=924}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Interpretation\nThe spatial distribution of renter occupied housing reveals important differences between the two fire perimeter areas. In the Palisades fire perimeter, the western coastal tract shows the highest renter occupancy at approximately the 40th percentile, meaning this area has more renters than 40% of California census tracts likely reflecting the concentration of apartments and vacation rentals near the beach. The remaining Palisades tracts show lower percentile rankings (10-25th), indicating these inland areas are predominantly owner occupied. \n\nThe Eaton fire perimeter displays greater variation, with some residential tracts reaching the 35-40th percentile range while large portions show minimal values corresponding to mountain terrain with little to no housing. These patterns indicate that both fires affected communities with notable renter populations, particularly in the Palisades coastal zone and Eaton's southwestern residential areas, suggesting these populations may face heightened vulnerability to displacement during the recovery process.\n\n# References\n- Assignment 4: Palisades & Eaton Fires.
