### Background
The Eaton and Palisades fires were two recent major wildfires that started from strong Santa Ana winds, dry vegetation from previous wet winters, and potential issues with electrical transmission lines. Both wildfires started simultaneously in Los Angeles County on January 07, 2025. These wildfires burned around 60 square miles and destroying thousands of structures and vegetation. A total of 37,000 acres burned across the Eaton and Palisades wildfires.

### Purpose
A NetCDF (`.nc`) file will be used for the Landsat raster covering Los Angeles County where two wildfires occurred during the year 2025. The first is a simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmospherically adjusted surface reflectance data, obtained by the Landsat 8 satellite. Using the wildfire shapefiles project them onto the Landsat to view where the fires occurred. An Environmental Justice Index (EJI) dataset for California is used to explore potential social factors influencing wildfire impacts.

### About Data
Microsoft Planetary Computer, [Link](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/landsat-c2-l2), is used in this notebook that outlines the fire perimeters for the Palisades and Eaton Fire. This was our data landsat data for the fire perimeters. `landsat8-2025-02-23-palisades-eaton.nc`

From the County of Los Angeles GIS, was retrieved for both fire perimeters of `Palisades` and `Eaton` fire as a shapefile (shp) each were added to a folder. 

- `california`: Is a geodatabase folder, that has rankings of geographic levels that represent comparison to all other census tracts.
- `eaton_boundary`:` Layer contains a dissolved fire perimeter for the eaton fire. (01/21/2025)
- `palisades_boundary`: Layer contains a dissolved fire perimeter for the palisades fire. (01/21/2025)
- `landsat`: This `nc` file contains a collection of bands (red, blue, green, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmosperically adjusted surface reflectance data, obtained by the Landsat 8 satellite. This data has been clipped to an area of Los Angeles County to include both fire perimeters.

This repository contains code and materials for analyzing Landsat imagery and mapping wildfire perimeters in Los Angeles County. It demonstrates how to:
- Work with NetCDF (.nc) Landsat data
- Create true-color (RGB) and false-color composites
- Overlay geospatial data to visualize fire boundaries
- Develop clear and reproducible geospatial workflows
- Identify a social dimension using EJI to explore potential vulnerability patterns within fire perimeters

The focus is on the Eaton and Palisades Fires, combining satellite imagery with official fire perimeter shapefiles to explore fire-affected areas.

### Highlights:
- Data Wrangling
- Restoring geospatial information
- False color imagery
- EJI Social Variable

# Data Exploration
### Fire Perimeters and EJI
Let's go ahead and conduct some exploration analysis in our fire paramteres, Eaton and Palisades fire. The first thing I wanted to check was the Coordinate Reprojection System (CRS), the bounding box's, and plot both shapefiles to see how they looked liked and what will have to be done when cleaning up the dataframes.
```{python}
# View landsat
landsat.head()

# Check CRSs
print(f"The CRS for Palisades is: {palisades.crs}")
print(f"The CRS for Eaton is: {eaton.crs}")
print(f"The CRS for EJI is: {eji.crs}")

# Check bounds
print(f'The bounding box of the Palisades fire is : {palisades.total_bounds}')
print(f'The bounding box of the Eaton fire is: {eaton.total_bounds}')
print(f'The bounding box of the EJI fire is: {eaton.total_bounds}')

# Check if projected or geographic for fire perimeters
print(f"{'Is the CRS geographic for Palisades?' : <25} {palisades.crs.is_geographic}")
print(f"{'Is the CRS projected for Palisades?' : <25} {palisades.crs.is_projected}")

print(f"{'Is the CRS geographic for Eaton?' : <25} {eaton.crs.is_geographic}")
print(f"{'Is the CRS projected for Eaton?' : <25} {eaton.crs.is_projected}")

print(f"{'Is the CRS geographic for EJI?' : <25} {eji.crs.is_geographic}")
print(f"{'Is the CRS projected for EJI?' : <25} {eji.crs.is_projected}")

# View DF's map
palisades.plot()
plt.title('Palisades Fire Perimeter')

eaton.plot()
plt.title('Eaton Fire Perimeter')

eji.plot()
plt.title('EJI')
```
From the data exploration analysis, all of our files have the CRS projected. The CRS for EJI is different compared to both fire perimeters. We can also visually see our the fire perimeters and EJI of California.

# Data Wrangling 
Here I wanted to make both Palisades and Eaton dataframes have lowercased headers to reduce errors when calling columns. Next, I wanted to make sure the CRS for both fire perimaters matched, more of a sanity check. In the code chunk before, I noticed the EJI dataframe had a different CRS than the fire perimeters. I will conduct a tranformation and will have a print statement to let me know that the transformation was confirmed. We will have to combine and clip the EJI and fire perimeters to get the information needed from EJI only on the eaton and palisades fire perimeters and not have all of California.
```{python}
# Lowercase column headers on both eaton and palisades dataframes
for df in [palisades, eaton]:
    df.columns = df.columns.str.lower()

# Match CRS
eaton.crs == palisades.crs  # False
print(f' The CRS for Eaton is: {eaton.crs} and the crs for palisades is: {palisades.crs}')

# Transform CRS
eji = eji.to_crs(palisades.crs)


# Check CRS match
assert eji.crs == palisades.crs
print("The EJI CRS match with Palisades CRS, after transformation :)")

# Join    
palisadesjoin = gpd.sjoin(eji,palisades)
eatonjoin = gpd.sjoin(eji, eaton)

# Clipping 
palisades_clip = gpd.clip(eji, palisades)
eaton_clip = gpd.clip(eji, eaton)

```
For both the Eaton and Palisades dataframes, all column names were converted to lowercase to ensure consistency and prevent errors when referencing columns later. The code then checks whether the datasets share the same Coordinate Reference System (CRS) and transforms the EJI layer to match the CRS of the fire perimeter datasets. After aligning the CRS, spatial joins are performed between EJI and each fire perimeter to identify overlapping features. Finally, the EJI layer is clipped to each fire perimeter boundary to produce area-specific subsets.


### Landsat Exploration and Wrangling
- For the landsat file, I will conduct exploratory analysis similar to the previous code chunks. Since the Landsat is a different file we will be using `rioxarray` to view the CRS. Following this we will extract the CRS using `spatial_ref`, from this we will overwrite the CRS to the dataset using geospatial information and spatial reference.

- The code begins by checking the CRS of the Landsat dataset using both the `rio.crs` attribute and the `spatial_ref` metadata field. It extracts the CRS in WKT format from the `spatial_ref` attribute and writes it back into the dataset to ensure the raster has an explicitly defined CRS.

```{python}
# Check CRS of Landsat
print(f"CRS:, {landsat.rio.crs}")

# Extract CRS using spatial_ref variable
wkt = landsat.spatial_ref.crs_wkt
print("\nCRS WKT from spatial_ref:")
print(wkt)

# Write the CRS to the dataset - geospatial information and spatial reference
landsat = landsat.rio.write_crs(wkt, inplace=False)

# Verify CRS is now attached
print("\nCRS after writing:", landsat.rio.crs)
```


In the Landsat file we will fill NA Values into collection of bands Red, green, and blue. This allows for `no NaN` error message to be removed. We will also assign it to an array.
```{python}
#  Substitute any NaN values with 0
landsat_filled = landsat.fillna(0)

# Add fillna() back into rgb
rgb_filled = landsat_filled[["red", "green", "blue"]].to_array()

# Assign numpy array to a variable
false_color = landsat[["swir22", "nir08", "red"]].to_array()

```
After confirming that the CRS is properly attached, the code fills all NaN values in the dataset with zeros to prevent errors during later processing or visualization. The filled dataset is then used to create RGB and false-color composites by selecting the appropriate spectral bands and converting them into NumPy arrays.

# Transform CRS from Eaton and Palisades fire to match Landsat
```{python}
# Transform Fire Perimeters to match landsat
eaton = eaton.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)
palisades = palisades.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)

# Check transformation
assert landsat.rio.crs == eaton.crs
assert landsat.rio.crs == palisades.crs
```
Since, Landsat dataset will be used as the base imagery, the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeter datasets must be reprojected to match the CRS of the Landsat file. The code transforms both fire perimeter layers to the Landsat CRS and then prints their CRS values to verify that the transformation was successful.

# False-Color Landsat Imagery
### Eaton and Palisades Fire Perimeters
- explain false color image is and why it is useful.
Without creating any new variables, create a false color image by plotting the short-wave infrared (swir22), near-infrared, and red variables (in that order).
A false color imagery, creates a figure that alludes to incorrect band match and projects false color imagery. Colors may be saturated to exaggerate or incorrectly labeling objects.
This map will create a False-Color imagery generated along with both fire perimeters, Eaton and Palisades boundary, using Landsat. 
```{python}
# Set up fig, ax
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,10))

# Plot false-color background first
false_color.plot.imshow(robust=True)

# Overlay fire perimeters
eaton.boundary.plot(ax=ax, color="hotpink", linewidth=2, label="Eaton Fire", facecolor = "lightpink", alpha = 0.6)
palisades.boundary.plot(ax=ax, color="red", linewidth=2, label="Palisades Fire", facecolor = "indianred", alpha = 0.6)

# Legend Patches
pal_legend = mpatches.Patch(facecolor="indianred", edgecolor="red", alpha=0.6, label="Palisades Fire")
eaton_legend = mpatches.Patch(facecolor="lightpink", edgecolor="hotpink", alpha=0.6, label="Eaton Fire")

# Zoom to fire extents - This is for the bound limits
xmin = min(eaton.total_bounds[0], palisades.total_bounds[0]) - 500
xmax = max(eaton.total_bounds[2], palisades.total_bounds[2]) + 500
ymin = min(eaton.total_bounds[1], palisades.total_bounds[1]) - 500
ymax = max(eaton.total_bounds[3], palisades.total_bounds[3]) + 500

# Set limits
ax.set_xlim(xmin, xmax)
ax.set_ylim(ymin, ymax) 

# Title
ax.set_title("SWIR-NIR-Red False Color Composite with Fire Perimeters")

# Legend
ax.legend(handles=[eaton_legend, pal_legend], 
          loc="upper left",
          title="Fire Perimeters",
          # Background of legend
          frameon=True)
ax.set_axis_off()
plt.show()
```
#### Interpretation
In this figure we are able to clearly see the areas that were affected by the wildfire that happened in Los Angeles County. With the false color imagery, it uses SWIR22 for red, NIR08 for green, and the Red band for blue. Bright green areas indicate healthy vegetation, while brown or muted areas correspond to bare ground or soil. The fire-affected regions are visible within the outlined perimeters. The fire perimeter of Palisades fire (red) and Eaton fire (pink) are identified by the colored boundary and an added text for easier identification. In this figure we are able to view both landscapes in Los Angeles and the fire perimeters that most recently occured.


# Eaton and Palisades Fire Perimeters with Basemap
```{python}

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(14, 12))

# Fire Perimeter- Eaton
eaton_clip.plot(ax=ax, color='orange', alpha=0.3)  # Inside
eaton_clip.plot(ax=ax, color='none', edgecolor='red', linewidth=1.5)  # Border

# Fire Perimeter- Palisades
palisades_clip.plot(ax=ax, color='blue', alpha=0.3)  # Inside
palisades_clip.plot(ax=ax, color='none', edgecolor='darkblue', linewidth=1.5)  # Border

# Legend Patches
pal_legend = mpatches.Patch(facecolor="blue", edgecolor="darkblue", alpha=0.3, label="Palisades Fire")
eaton_legend = mpatches.Patch(facecolor="orange", edgecolor="red", alpha=0.3, label="Eaton Fire")

# Legend
ax.legend(handles=[eaton_legend, pal_legend], 
          loc="upper left",
          title="Fire Perimeters",
          # Background of legend
          frameon=True)

# Title
ax.set_title("2025 Eaton and Palisades Fire")

# Axes off
ax.axis('off')

# Basemap
ctx.add_basemap(ax, source=ctx.providers.OpenStreetMap.Mapnik)

plt.show()


```
#### Interpretation
In this figure, the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeters are displayed on an OpenStreetMap basemap. Compared to the earlier Landsat imagery, this basemap provides clearer visual context by highlighting roads, highways, and city boundaries. This makes it easier to interpret where each fire occurred in relation to nearby communities and surrounding infrastructure.

# Community’s Response To A Wildfire
### Renter Occupancy Across Fire Perimeters
Using the 2024 Environmental Justice Index data for California in the geodatabase data format, `EJI_2024_California`, I will plot the fire perimeters of Eaton and Palisades to showcase Housing Units, Occupied by Renters. In the Palisades area it is more common for more homeowners to own homes and rent them out since it is near a beach and often added to vacation rentals. In the Eaton area, 
```{python}
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(20, 10))

# Add EJI Variable - Using Metadata
eji_variable = 'E_RENTER'

# Find common min/max for legend range
vmin = min(palisades_clip[eji_variable].min(), eaton_clip[eji_variable].min())
vmax = max(palisades_clip[eji_variable].max(), eaton_clip[eji_variable].max())

# Plot census tracts within Palisades perimeter
palisades_clip.plot(
column= eji_variable,
vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax,
legend=False,
ax=ax1,
cmap = 'inferno')

ax1.set_title('Palisades Fire')
ax1.axis('off')

# Plot census tracts within Eaton perimeter
eaton_clip.plot(
column=eji_variable,
vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax,
legend=False,
ax=ax2,
cmap='inferno')

ax2.set_title('Eaton Fire')
ax2.axis('off')

# Add overall title
fig.suptitle('Percentile of housing units that are renter occupied')

# Add shared colorbar at the bottom
sm = plt.cm.ScalarMappable(norm=plt.Normalize(vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax), cmap = 'inferno')
cbar_ax = fig.add_axes([0.25, 0.08, 0.5, 0.02]) # [left, bottom, width, height]
cbar = fig.colorbar(sm, cax=cbar_ax, orientation='horizontal')
cbar.set_label('Percentile of Housing Units, Occupied by Renter')
plt.show()
```
#### Interpretation
In the Palisades fire area, renter occupied housing units appear more concentrated along the coastal tracts. These coastal zones often contain higher density housing and short term rental activity, which may contribute to higher renter occupancy rates. Compared to the Eaton fire perimeter, renter occupied units are primarily concentrated in the southwestern portion, where residential development is present. Much of the remaining area within the Eaton perimeter covers mountainous terrain with little or no housing, resulting in low or zero values for renter occupancy.
