### Background
The Eaton and Palisades fires were two recent major wildfires that started from strong Santa Ana winds, dry vegetation from previous wet winters, and potential issues with electrical transmission lines. Both wildfires started simultaneously in Los Angeles County on January 07, 2025. These wildfires burned around 60 square miles and destroying thousands of structures and vegetation. A total of 37,000 acres burned across the Eaton and Palisades wildfires.

### Purpose
A NetCDF (`.nc`) file will be used for the Landsat raster covering Los Angeles County where two wildfires occurred during the year 2025. The first is a simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmospherically adjusted surface reflectance data, obtained by the Landsat 8 satellite. Using the wildfire shapefiles project them onto the Landsat to view where the fires occurred. An Environmental Justice Index (EJI) dataset for California is used to explore potential social factors influencing wildfire impacts.

### About Data
Microsoft Planetary Computer, [Link](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/landsat-c2-l2), is used in this notebook that outlines the fire perimeters for the Palisades and Eaton Fire. This was our data landsat data for the fire perimeters. `landsat8-2025-02-23-palisades-eaton.nc`

From the County of Los Angeles GIS, was retrieved for both fire perimeters of `Palisades` and `Eaton` fire as a shapefile (shp) each were added to a folder. 

- `california`: Is a geodatabase folder, that has rankings of geographic levels that represent comparison to all other census tracts.
- `eaton_boundary`:` Layer contains a dissolved fire perimeter for the eaton fire. (01/21/2025)
- `palisades_boundary`: Layer contains a dissolved fire perimeter for the palisades fire. (01/21/2025)
- `landsat`: This `nc` file contains a collection of bands (red, blue, green, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmosperically adjusted surface reflectance data, obtained by the Landsat 8 satellite. This data has been clipped to an area of Los Angeles County to include both fire perimeters.

This repository contains code and materials for analyzing Landsat imagery and mapping wildfire perimeters in Los Angeles County. It demonstrates how to:
- Work with NetCDF (.nc) Landsat data
- Create true-color (RGB) and false-color composites
- Overlay geospatial data to visualize fire boundaries
- Develop clear and reproducible geospatial workflows
- Identify a social dimension using EJI to explore potential vulnerability patterns within fire perimeters

The focus is on the Eaton and Palisades Fires, combining satellite imagery with official fire perimeter shapefiles to explore fire-affected areas.

### Highlights:
- Data Wrangling
- Restoring geospatial information
- False color imagery
- EJI Social Variable

# Packages Used:
This notebook uses the following Python packages: `contextily`, `os`,  `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `matplotlib.patches`, `geopandas`, `rioxarray`, and `xarray`.

# Import Libraries
```{python}
import contextily as ctx
import os
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.patches as mpatches
import geopandas as gpd
import rioxarray
import xarray as xr
```

# Import data
```{python}
# Import landsat `nc` file
landsat = xr.open_dataset('data/landsat8-2025-02-23-palisades-eaton.nc')

# Import fire shapefile data
fp = os.path.join('data/eaton_perimeter/Eaton_Perimeter_20250121.shp')
eaton = gpd.read_file(fp)
fp = os.path.join('data/palisades_perimeter/Palisades_Perimeter_20250121.shp')
palisades = gpd.read_file(fp)

california = gpd.read_file(os.path.join("data/EJI_2024_California/EJI_2024_California.gdb"))


```

# Data Wrangling 
```{python}
# Lower column titles on dataframes
for df in [palisades, eaton]:
    df.columns = df.columns.str.lower()
    
# Match CRS
eaton.crs == palisades.crs  # False

california = california.to_crs(palisades.crs) # Transform CRS

california.crs == palisades.crs # True / Match

# Join    
palisadesjoin = gpd.sjoin(california,palisades)
eatonjoin = gpd.sjoin(california, eaton)

# Clipping 
palisades_clip = gpd.clip(california, palisades)
eaton_clip = gpd.clip(california, eaton)

```
For both the Eaton and Palisades dataframes, all column names were converted to lowercase to ensure consistency and prevent errors when referencing columns later. The code then checks whether the datasets share the same Coordinate Reference System (CRS) and transforms the California layer to match the CRS of the fire perimeter datasets. After aligning the CRS, spatial joins are performed between California and each fire perimeter to identify overlapping features. Finally, the California layer is clipped to each fire perimeter boundary to produce area-specific subsets.


# Landsat.nc file
```{python}
# Check CRS of Landsat
print(f"CRS:, {landsat.rio.crs}")

# Extract CRS using spatial_ref variable
wkt = landsat.spatial_ref.crs_wkt
print("\nCRS WKT from spatial_ref:")
print(wkt)

# Write the CRS to the dataset - geospatial information and spatial reference
landsat = landsat.rio.write_crs(wkt, inplace=False)

# Verify CRS is now attached
print("\nCRS after writing:", landsat.rio.crs)


# Fill NA Values into collection of bands Red, green, and blue. This allows for `no NaN` error message to be removed.
#  Substitute any NaN values with 0
landsat_filled = landsat.fillna(0)

# Add fillna() back into rgb
rgb_filled = landsat_filled[["red", "green", "blue"]].to_array()

# Assign numpy array to a variable
false_color = landsat[["swir22", "nir08", "red"]].to_array()

```
The code begins by checking the CRS of the Landsat dataset using both the `rio.crs` attribute and the `spatial_ref` metadata field. It extracts the CRS in WKT format from the `spatial_ref` attribute and writes it back into the dataset to ensure the raster has an explicitly defined CRS. After confirming that the CRS is properly attached, the code fills all NaN values in the dataset with zeros to prevent errors during later processing or visualization. The filled dataset is then used to create RGB and false-color composites by selecting the appropriate spectral bands and converting them into NumPy arrays.

# Transform CRS from Eaton and Palisades fire to match landsat
```{python}
# Transform Fire Perimeters to match landsat
eaton = eaton.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)
palisades = palisades.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)

# Check transformation
print("Eaton CRS:", eaton.crs) # EPSG:32611
print("Palisades CRS:", palisades.crs) # EPSG:32611
```
Since, Landsat dataset will be used as the base imagery, the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeter datasets must be reprojected to match the CRS of the Landsat file. The code transforms both fire perimeter layers to the Landsat CRS and then prints their CRS values to verify that the transformation was successful.

# Map 1 - False-Color Landsat Imagery with Fire Perimeters
This map will create a False-Color imagery generated along with both fire perimeters, eaton and palisades boundary, using landsat. 
```{python}
# Set up fig, ax
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,10))

# Plot false-color background first
false_color.plot.imshow(robust=True)

# Overlay fire perimeters
eaton.boundary.plot(ax=ax, color="hotpink", linewidth=2, label="Eaton Fire", facecolor = "lightpink", alpha = 0.6)
palisades.boundary.plot(ax=ax, color="red", linewidth=2, label="Palisades Fire", facecolor = "indianred", alpha = 0.6)


# Add label for Eaton fire perimeter
ax.text(eaton.geometry.centroid.iloc[0].x,
        eaton.geometry.centroid.iloc[0].y,
        "Eaton Fire", color="black", fontsize=10, weight="bold", bbox=dict(facecolor='lightgrey', alpha=0.5, pad=5))

# Add labels for Palisades fire perimeter
ax.text(palisades.geometry.centroid.iloc[0].x,
        palisades.geometry.centroid.iloc[0].y,
        "Palisades Fire", color="black", fontsize=10, weight="bold", bbox=dict(facecolor='lightgrey', alpha=0.5, pad=5))


# Zoom to fire extents - This is for the bound limits
xmin = min(eaton.total_bounds[0], palisades.total_bounds[0]) - 500
xmax = max(eaton.total_bounds[2], palisades.total_bounds[2]) + 500
ymin = min(eaton.total_bounds[1], palisades.total_bounds[1]) - 500
ymax = max(eaton.total_bounds[3], palisades.total_bounds[3]) + 500

# Set limits
ax.set_xlim(xmin, xmax)
ax.set_ylim(ymin, ymax) 

# Title
ax.set_title("SWIR-NIR-Red False Color Composite with Fire Perimeters")

# Legend
ax.legend(loc = "upper left")
ax.set_axis_off()
plt.show()
```
#### Interpretation
In this figure we are able to clearly see the areas that were affected by the wildfire that happened in Los Angeles County. With the false color imagery, it uses SWIR22 for red, NIR08 for green, and the Red band for blue. Bright green areas indicate healthy vegetation, while brown or muted areas correspond to bare ground or soil. The fire-affected regions are visible within the outlined perimeters. The fire perimeter of Palisades fire (red) and Eaton fire (pink) are identified by the colored boundary and an added text for easier identification. In this figure we are able to view both landscapes in Los Angeles and the fire perimeters that most recently occured.


# Map 2 - Fire Perimeters with Basemap
```{python}

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(14, 12))

# Fire Perimeter- Eaton
eaton_clip.plot(ax=ax, color='orange', alpha=0.3)  # Inside
eaton_clip.plot(ax=ax, color='none', edgecolor='red', linewidth=1.5)  # Border

# Fire Perimeter- Palisades
palisades_clip.plot(ax=ax, color='blue', alpha=0.3)  # Inside
palisades_clip.plot(ax=ax, color='none', edgecolor='darkblue', linewidth=1.5)  # Border

# Legend Patches
pal_legend = mpatches.Patch(facecolor="blue", edgecolor="darkblue", alpha=0.3, label="Palisades Fire")
eaton_legend = mpatches.Patch(facecolor="orange", edgecolor="red", alpha=0.3, label="Eaton Fire")

# Legend
ax.legend(handles=[eaton_legend, pal_legend], 
          loc="upper left",
          title="Fire Perimeters",
          # Background of legend
          frameon=True)

# Title
ax.set_title("2025 Eaton and Palisades Fire")

# Axes off
ax.axis('off')

# Basemap
ctx.add_basemap(ax, source=ctx.providers.OpenStreetMap.Mapnik)

plt.show()


```
#### Interpretation
In this figure, the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeters are displayed on an OpenStreetMap basemap. Compared to the earlier Landsat imagery, this basemap provides clearer visual context by highlighting roads, highways, and city boundaries. This makes it easier to interpret where each fire occurred in relation to nearby communities and surrounding infrastructure.

# Map 3 - Renter Occupancy Across Fire Perimeters
Using the 2024 Environmental Justice Index data for California in the geodatabase data format, `EJI_2024_California`, plot the fire perimeters of Eaton and Palisades to showcasing Housing Units, Occupied by Renters.
```{python}
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(20, 10))

# Add EJI Variable - Using Metadata
eji_variable = 'E_RENTER'

# Find common min/max for legend range
vmin = min(palisades_clip[eji_variable].min(), eaton_clip[eji_variable].min())
vmax = max(palisades_clip[eji_variable].max(), eaton_clip[eji_variable].max())

# Plot census tracts within Palisades perimeter
palisades_clip.plot(
column= eji_variable,
vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax,
legend=False,
ax=ax1,
cmap = 'inferno')

ax1.set_title('Palisades Fire')
ax1.axis('off')

# Plot census tracts within Eaton perimeter
eaton_clip.plot(
column=eji_variable,
vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax,
legend=False,
ax=ax2,
cmap='inferno')

ax2.set_title('Eaton Fire')
ax2.axis('off')

# Add overall title
fig.suptitle('Percentage of housing units that are renter occupied')

# Add shared colorbar at the bottom
sm = plt.cm.ScalarMappable(norm=plt.Normalize(vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax), cmap = 'inferno')
cbar_ax = fig.add_axes([0.25, 0.08, 0.5, 0.02]) # [left, bottom, width, height]
cbar = fig.colorbar(sm, cax=cbar_ax, orientation='horizontal')
cbar.set_label('Percentile of Housing Units, Occupied by Renter')
plt.show()
```
#### Interpretation
In the Palisades fire area, renter occupied housing units appear more concentrated along the coastal tracts. These coastal zones often contain higher density housing and short term rental activity, which may contribute to higher renter occupancy rates. Compared to the Eaton fire perimeter, renter occupied units are primarily concentrated in the southwestern portion, where residential development is present. Much of the remaining area within the Eaton perimeter covers mountainous terrain with little or no housing, resulting in low or zero values for renter occupancy.
